## CI/CD Pipeline

This project is fully integrated with a CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and seamless deployment:

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Unit Tests**: The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for unit testing. All components and logic are thoroughly tested to ensure correctness.
- **End-to-End Tests**: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is used for E2E testing to verify the application's behavior in a browser environment.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI workflows are configured using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push or pull request to the `main` or `master` branches.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Vercel Auto Deployment**: The project is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with automatic deployments triggered on every push to the `main` branch. This ensures the latest changes are always live.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying files in the `app/` directory. The application supports hot-reloading, so changes will reflect immediately.
