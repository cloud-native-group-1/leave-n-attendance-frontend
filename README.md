# Leave and Attendance Management System

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It provides a platform for managing leave requests, attendance tracking, and team monitoring.

## Features

- **Leave Requests**: Submit and manage leave requests with an intuitive interface.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Monitor attendance records for team members.
- **Team Monitoring**: View team performance and activity summaries.
- **Notifications**: Stay updated with real-time notifications.
- **Reports**: Generate detailed reports for analysis.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying files in the `app/` directory. The application supports hot-reloading, so changes will reflect immediately.
